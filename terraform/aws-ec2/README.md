# Create an EC2 instance on AWS


## Authentication

**Option 1**: credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) in AWS CLI.

- install AWS CLI if not already;
- authenticate with AWS CLI: `aws configure` and follow the prompts.
  This will create the credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`) with `default` profile.
